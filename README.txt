The main goal of this program is to provide an opportunity to create a network application.

This program is representative of a larger class of network-enabled systems:

* It will have a protocol for communication between clients and server
* it will allow communication over a network (specifically by accepting TCP connections from clients)
* It will use concurrency and synchronization primitives to coordinate access to shared data on a remote server
